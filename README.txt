Make sure that when the program opens you DO NOT close the command prompt window, it will close the GUI tab with it. (You do not need to pay any attention to this if the Command Prompt update has this: "✔️" next to it)
In order to run this program please do the following:
~Create a blank Word/.docx document that you want the notes to be put in
~Right click the program and click "Run as Adminstrator"
~Then follow the onscreen prompts to the left of the text boxes
~Now press extract and you should be all good
